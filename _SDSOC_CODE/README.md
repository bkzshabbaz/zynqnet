# ZynqNet FPGA Accelerator + Firmware for SDSoC

for the Zynq XC-7Z045 System on Chip

This code was modified to work with Xilinx SDSoC.

Utility code is from SDSoC_Examples git project: [https://github.com/Xilinx/SDSoC_Examples]

To compile:

```
$ source /opt/Xilinx/SDx/2017.2/settings64.sh
$ make all
```

Please note, I do not possess a ZCU102 development kit so I can't test the code.  I can only build it.
